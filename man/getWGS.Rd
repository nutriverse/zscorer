\title{getWGS}
\usage{
getWGS(sexObserved, firstPart, secondPart, index)
}
\arguments{
\item{sexObserved}{Sex of child (1 = Male; 2 = Female)}

\item{firstPart}{Weight (in kg for WHZ and WAZ) or height (in cm for HAZ)}

\item{secondPart}{Age (in months for HAZ and WAZ) or height (in cm for WHZ)}

\item{index}{One of "wfh", "hfa", "wfa" (specifies the required index)}
}
\value{
z-score of the anthropometric index selected
}
\description{
Calculate z-scores for WHZ, HAZ, WAZ using the WHO Growth Reference (2006)
for a single child data.
}
\section{Warning}{

The function fails messily when \code{secondPart} is outside of the range
given in the WGS reference (i.e. 45 to 120 cm for height and 0 to 60 months
for age). It is up to you to check the ranges of your data.
}

\section{Reminders}{

The reference data for W/H assumes supine length is used for children with a
standing height below 85cm

Heights should be specified in cm to the nearest mm (i.e. to 1 d.p.)

Ages should be specified in whole months

Weights should be specified in kg to available precision

The function requires reference data \code{wgsData} included in this package
}

\section{Note}{

This is a legacy function from the first CRAN release of \code{zscorer}
which focused mainly on the calculation of z-scores for weight-for-age,
weight-for-height and height-for-age. This function has been kept in the package
to ensure that existing analysis workflows implemented using the function
continue to work.
